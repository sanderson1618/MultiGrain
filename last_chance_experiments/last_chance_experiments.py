Second, I explain grain sizes. They live in the '/GSDs' folder. Any user can go
take a look at them. As this project moves formward, I will find a place to
put the "raw" grain size data, but for now the data is presented in a way that
this code can understand. 

There are a few different excels in the grain size folder. Note to self: Eventually 
some of these comments will be readmes or some folder explanation or whatever. 
Anyways, there are 3 excels which represent real GSDs and were measured with 
drone photos. 

Column 0, in the LC3 gsd file, are b axis diameters for the 'shallow' channel 
section (above 1560m elevation), 1 are diameters for 1530m - 1560m elevation,
and 2 are diameters for steep elevations lower than 1530. 

For LC1 column 0 are diameters for elevations above 1560 m, column 1 are diameters
for elevations 1540 - 1560m, and column 2 are grain size diameters in elevations
lower than 1540 m in elevation.
    
The corresponding GSD info for LC1 is...
    LC1_grain_size_dist.xlsx
    and LC1_gsd_locations.txt
    
...and for LC3 is 
    LC3_grain_size_dist.xlsx
    and LC3_gsd_locations.txt

    bins) this one is called LC3_grain_size_dist_higher_res.xlsx

Here we have precip data
I have a folder called climate where all the different .xlsx files which 
control intensity and duration live. To call them use first the duration, in
minutes, and then the recurrence interval (RI) in years and then "storm". like so...

#duration_#yrRI_storm.xlsx

for example a 5 minute long storm with a 1 year RI would be experessed like so...

5min_1yrRI_storm.xlsx

The only things that need to be changed are the numbers (in this case 5 and 1), and
sometimes the duration units (min, hours, days)

The shortest storm is 5 minutes, the longest is yet to be determined, but will 
most likely be one day. The lowest RI is 1 and the highest is 1000. Feel free 
to open the climate folder to decide on a storm to run!
